Clock
</h1>
<p>
My friend who also is doing a coding project except that he is doing for a year. So he made a clock for his website today and asked me to do it. So I made it after a lot of problems and at the end I reliazed how easy it actually it was. You can use this website to know the time when your clock/watch is broken.
