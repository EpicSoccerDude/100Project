Disappearance 
</h1>
<p>
I was learning more javascript on W3schools today and it taught me how to hide and show. So I thought, maybe I should make something with this for today's website. I then made 3 paragraphs with three buttons. If you click the button, the paragraph under it dissapears. You could click on it again for it to come back as well.
