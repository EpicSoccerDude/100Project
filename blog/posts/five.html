Weird Button
</h1>
<p>
I was inspired my friend when I went to his house for a sleepover. I was just making a button for fun and I asked him what color should be my background. He told me put rainbow. I didn't think it would work, but it actually did. It was a weird button and that is why I have named today's website Weird Button.
