    So you must be thinking........"Why is this person doing this?" Well, I am doing this to learn how to code. I will be doing a 100 websites in a 100 days. Which obviously means a website per day. I am still a beginner coder so my websites will not be that complex. Well, since you now know about this project, follow my websites and have fun with em.
