<h2>
It is a good story.
</h2>
<p>
There once was a man who told a story about his life. He was very stressed when he lost his little toy in the first grade. He also was a bully after that.Then he said that he wanted some good old adventure. He went to the store for some adventure. He saw a man steal an apple and this was his moment to go after him and get some adventure. You know what he did......he thought about it. And came to a conclusion that he SHOULD NOT go chase him. You know why, its tooo faaar. That was this man's life of adventure.
